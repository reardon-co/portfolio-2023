Dear Reader,

<br>
Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio site.

I'm Cole Reardon, a Northeastern alumnus, where I studied Computer Science and Business Administration. My passion lies in pursuing a career in software engineering, though product management and entrepreneurship also greatly intrigue me.

With over a year of professional experience in software engineering, I've had the privilege of working in both startup and corporate environments, which has enriched my understanding of diverse challenges in the tech world.

Beyond coding, you'll find me gaming, exploring captivating books, or jet-setting around the globe, embracing new adventures.

I am confident in my ability to adapt to any challenge that comes my way, and I'm eager to contribute my skillset and energy to your next project.

Feel free to reach out, and let's make something extraordinary together!

</br>
Best, </br>Cole Reardon
