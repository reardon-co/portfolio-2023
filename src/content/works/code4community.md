description: At Code4Community, I worked on creating a platform that helps children apply for This Star Won't Go Out grants. This Star Won't Go Out is a charity working to provide aid to families dealing with childhood cancer. I created an advanced sorting and filtering algorithm for admins of the application portal via React.
